# Quantitative Analysis of Political Texts {#qta}

This readme file contains a brief description of an analysis I performed of Twitter data from Chilean deputies during the year 2018. 
The full version of this analysis was published in a chapter of quantitative text analysis in the book [R for Political Data Science](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/quantitative-analysis-political-texts-sebasti%C3%A1n-huneeus/e/10.1201/9781003010623-13).

I downloaded all the Tweets and then carried a series of descriptive analysis and topic models.  



## Part 1: Hashtag analysis 

In the study of contemporary social movements, hashtags like #metoo, #blacklivesmatter and #niunamenos can tell a rich story on how a protest evolves. Hashtags contain valuable semantic information of the tone, spread or speed of a protest. The protest cycle Ola Feminista (Feminist Wave), occurred in Chile from May to June of 2018, denounced gender inequalities and started as a mobilization of students in Santiago, and gradually grew expanding to broader demands from feminist and worker organizations across Chile.

I was curious about how deputies related or resonated with the protests, so I downloaded all the tweets from May to June of 2018 of all the deputies with an active Twitter account. Then I kept all the tweets containing at least one hashtag. 

For downloading the tweets I used the package
