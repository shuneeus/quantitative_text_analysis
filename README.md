# Quantitative Analysis of Political Texts {#qta}

This readme file contains a brief description of an analysis I performed of Twitter data from Chilean deputies during the year 2018. I downloaded all the Tweets and then carried a series of descriptive analysis and topic models.  



## Part 1: Hashtag analysis 


In the study of contentious politics hashtags like #metoo, #blacklivesmatter and #niunamenos are hashtags that get viral and tell a rich story of the social media activism and protest. The protest cycle Ola Feminista (Feminist Wave), which occurred in Chile from May to June of 2018, denounced structural gender inequalities and started as a mobilization of students in Santiago, and gradually grew expanding to broader demands from feminist and worker organizations across Chile.

I downloaded all the tweets from May to June of 2018 of all the deputies with an active Twitter account. Then I kept all the tweets containing at least one hashtag.
